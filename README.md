## what is ourealm?

ourealm is almost entirely nondescript in its current phase. 
however, its nondescriptness is intentional.
ourealm exists as an autonomous corner of the internet for BIPOC, femmes, and LGBTQ+
to make into whatever we imagine, or want it to be. 
any single individual who has a realm in ourealm simultaneously has access to all other realms,
and this isn't figurative language. 
inorder to have a blog, web page, or any extenstension of ourealm not only allows, but requires that 
access to all other pages, and all other source code, be accessible, and therefore changeable. 
in the event that ourealm becomes yet another toxic sphere on the internet it is totally free to be deleted in 
its entirety by any cohabitant of ourealm.
this level of openness and vulnerability will likely require an unprecedented level of trust and respect within the community,
and it is by way of openness, vulnerability, trust, and respect, that we can lay the groundwork for this community.

beneath all this, ourealm additionally exists as an opportunity to increase technological literacy within our community.
ourealm is completely free, and likely to be a low traffic space on the internet, where one can experiment, and learn
how to build webpages, blogs, etc. of their own.
